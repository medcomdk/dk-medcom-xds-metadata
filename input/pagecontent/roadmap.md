# XDS Metadata Standard Roadmap

## Purpose

The XDS Metadata Standard Roadmap is established to communicate what we are working with right now and give an intention of what we will work with in the future.

- **Now:** is the intention of the current version. This has *a quite accurate* character of a description of what to expect in the upcoming version in overview.
- **Next:** is the intention of the next version. This has *more* a character of a description of the good guess based on the current expectations
- **Later:** is the intention of the next version. This has *most* a character of a description of the good guess based on the current expectations

What can be expected for sure is that the roadmap will try to express the constant adapting of rquirements from projects in the Danish XDS Infrastructure, while being loyal and compliant with the international Standard for being so.
