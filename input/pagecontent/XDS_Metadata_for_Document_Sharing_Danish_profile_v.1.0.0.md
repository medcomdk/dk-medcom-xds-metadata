The first version of this document was prepared by the National Sundheds-it now known as Sundhedsdatastyrelsen (en: Danish Health Data Authority) in collaboration with a workgroup composed by a number of partners from the health sector and suppliers of ICT solutions to the healthcare sector.

The work group held 2 workshops in the period from November 2014 to December 2014. The work group included:

### Audience

The audience for this document includes software developers and implementers of products and services for the Danish Document Sharing Service (DDS).

### Introduction

The Danish Document Sharing Service is based on IHE XDS specifications. The aim is that the document can be used for implementing XDS Metadata across Danish IHE Affinity Domains. Metadata is information about documents or records that is used when searching to find the right item. This metadata has to be supplied by the document source and is generally limited to what can be provided by source information systems.

Each XDS system requires an XDS Affinity Domain (XAD), which establishes the rules and conventions about the type of clinical documents, metadata codes, security constraints and other policies that **SHALL** be used. One of the tasks in setting up an affinity domain is to specify the metadata code sets that are allowed. In Denmark this work is ongoing and not yet finalized.

This document specifies (for trial purposes) metadata to be used in Denmark. The metadata specification has until now had a focus on the use of HL7 CDA, especially the Danish profile of the CDA PHMR, Questionnaires and the Danish CDA header profile, but will from now on focus broader on XDS metadata for all kinds of documents, since IHE XDS is not limited to HL7 CDA documents. The metadata set in this document has been derived from and mapped to IHE XDS and includes information about the patient, the document, the author and the service being documented.

The metadata was originally used and assessed in pilot projects in 2018. The experiences from the pilot project and other later projects will systematically be collected and used for updates of this document.

Initial assumptions and assessments were made for establishing the foundational code systems for the Danish XDS Metadata ValueSet. Due to a broader use of this standard in relation to the ongoing work of sharing documents through the XDS infrastructure, these initial assessments and assumptions have now being superseded by practice and therefore new code systems will be added and existing systems extended, when need be.

The IBI[^1] project for the registration of image data on XDS-I was part of this work but need some more work to be finalized.

[^1]: IBI – Interregional Billedindeks (Interregional Image Index) (2016)

The requirements for the XDS registry transactions (as ebXML Registry Package) are not part of this specification.

This version of the document is produced by MedCom, who has taken the responsibility role as custodian of this standard. This document will still reflect most of the style from the initial work done by the Danish Health Data Authority.

## Document Sharing

### Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (XDS)

IHE XDS enables healthcare documents to be shared over a wide area network, between hospitals, primary care providers, social services and others in the patients’ circle or web of care. Rather than having one big database at the centre, IHE XDS fits the distributed collaborative approach to sharing clinical documents where they are held in different organizations. The primary components in XDS are a centralized Registry and one or more local Repositories. The XDS Registry stores metadata, which is queried to retrieve documents, while local XDS Repositories store the actual documents. The Registry and Repositories are logically and physically separate. A book library provides an analogy for explaining how XDS works: A library has books and a central index. An index entry for each book points to where to find the book on the library shelves together with brief details of the content. In the same way, the XDS Registry contains standardized metadata describing the content of each item and where to find it. The Repository **MAY** contain any type of electronic content much like the library shelves **MAY** contain any type of book or other media. Every item in the Repository has corresponding metadata in the Registry just as every book in the library has an entry in the index. XDS enables external user applications to retrieve documents from one or more repositories in a quick and consistent way. Each document is retrieved in its original form, which **MAY** be structured or unstructured. Every XDS implementation has five actors: Document Source, Document Repository, Document Registry, Document Consumer and Patient Identity Source.

#### Patient Identity Source

The Patient Identity Source provides a unique XDS identifier for each and every patient in the affinity domain. In Denmark we are using the CPR-number for this XDS patient identifier

#### Document Source

The Document Source submits HL7 CDA documents (or other documents) to a (local) Document Repository. Each organization **MAY** maintain its own Repository.

#### Document Repository

The Document Repository provides a persistent store for each document. It assigns a unique Identifier (uniqueId) to each document for subsequent retrieval by a Document Consumer.

In case of an updated version of the document will provide a new uniqueId and replacing the previous document, and updating metadata in Document Registry.

#### Document Registry

The Document Registry provides an index to all registered documents in the repositories about each patient using the patient identifier as the key. One Registry can index documents in any number of Repositories. It maintains a link (pointer) back to the Repository where each document is stored. The Registry supports queries to find metadata about documents irrespective of where they are actually stored. To maintain security, the Registry has no access to the content of any document, but relies only on standardized metadata to retrieve relevant documents.

#### Document Consumer

The Document Consumer submits queries to the Registry to get document metadata meeting specified query criteria, which are then used for locating the repository and retrieving the actual document from it. The Consumer can now retrieve the document(s). In order to retrieve a document, the following metadata attributes are required: homeCommunityId, repositoryUniqueId and document id (uniqueId).


### OID values used in Danish metadata

More of the metadata attributes are derived from national and international classifications. A “coded” attribute include three values:

-   code (the id in the classification)
-   displayName (the value for the code)
-   codeSystem (the OID for the used classification)

The table below shows the classification systems used in this document including the used OID’s. The table is consistent with the OID’s and classifications used in the Danish PHMR profile.

More information on the classification systems are described in APPENDIX 1 – Classification systems.


### XDS Metadata attributes: Reading instructions

The XDS metadata attributes are described in chapter 2, using a uniform template.

#### Attribute - Basic information

A table shows the basic information for the attributes:

<img src="xds-basic-etities.png" alt="xds-basic-etities table" style="vertical-align:left;margin:15px 700px 15px 15px"/>

Entity: The entity/entities, where the attribute are used.

Optionality: The optionality for the attribute according to optionality code definitions given in Table 3.

Data type: The data type for the attribute (HL7 v2 data types).

Source: The data source for the attribute according to

Table 4. The text (transformation) informs that the CDA data, which are based on HL7 v3 data types, **SHALL** be transformed to HL7 v2 data types.

#### Attribute – Description

The section *description* is describing the use of the attribute in a Danish health context. More information regarding the respective attributes can be found in the background documents as listed in section 1.2 of this document. The IHE-ITF-Vol3] is the main source of information. The other listed documents can provide knowledge about technical and clinical related to use in an implementation setup.

#### Attribute – Coding

The section *Coding* describes how the coding of the attributes **SHALL** be performed.

The section also includes (when applicable) colored boxes with examples on mapping to HL7 CDA, other requirements (RDK) and an XML metadata example.


### Allowed value sets for Danish metadata attributes

For some of the metadata attributes the corresponding value set is comprised of a limited sub-set of a code system. It is marked for those metadata attributes that have a limited value set in the Coding section. Like this:

*This metadata attribute has a value set comprised of a sub-set of values defined in a code system. See this reference for further information [DK-IHE_Metadata Value_sets]*.

#### [DK-IHE_Metadata Value_sets]

The allowed values in the value set, are listed in the Excel document placed at a public website at MedCom:

https://svn.medcom.dk/svn/releases/Standarder/IHE/OID/DK-IHE_Metadata-Common_Code_systems-Value_sets.xlsx

Go to the tab for a given metadata attribute to look up allowed values for the given metadata attribute. Further instructions are written in the first tab “Instruction” of the Excel file.

### Overview of Danish IHE XDS Metadata refinement and localization.

Table 5 Danish localization and refinement of Metadata shows which metadata attributes has been specially treated and narrowed for Danish document and image sharing (column ‘Refined for Danish use’) and which is either not in use or is as-is in the international IHE metadata profile without any Danish specialization needs.

The column ‘Danish Value Sets’ shows which metadata attribute has a limited allowed value set. See this reference for further information see section 1.3.4.1 [DK-IHE_Metadata Value_sets].

| DocumentEntry SubmissionSet | R           | Predefined URN | AUT    |

**Description:**

Represents the status of the DocumentEntry. A DocumentEntry **SHALL** have one of two availability statuses:

-   Approved (The document is available for patient care).
-   Deprecated (The document is obsolete)

It is always set to Approved as a result of the successful submission of new documents. It **MAY** be changed to Deprecated under the primary responsibility of the creating entity.

**Coding:**

The format of the availabilityStatus value is a URN.

In a query response the value is coded in the status attribute of the ExtrinsicObject representing the DocumentEntry and **SHALL** be 
    
        "urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:StatusType:Approved" 
        
        or 
        
        "urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:StatusType:Deprecated" 
        
        The example below shows the status attribute.

**XML example:**

      <ExtrinsicObject  
        id="urn:uuid:fbeacdb7-5421-4474-9267-985007cd8855"

### classCode

**General information:**

| Entity        | Optionality | Data type | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| DocumentEntry | R           | Code      | RDK    |

**Description:**

The classCode attribute specifies the high-level use classification of the document type (e.g., Clinical Document, Report, Image and Treatment Plan).

The classCode attribute is related to the typeCode and has a lower degree of granularity for the classification of the document. The typeCode attribute (see 2.2.32) specifies the precise type of document from the user perspective.

In this profile, the classCode is given by values in the code system DK IHE classCodes described in section 3.7.

**Coding:**

This metadata attribute has a limited allowed value set. See this reference for further information see section 1.3.4.1 [DK-IHE_Metadata Value_sets].

There **SHALL** be exactly one ebRIM Classification containing a classCode for any DocumentEntry. For the classCode metadata attribute, the classificationScheme **SHALL** be urn: urn:uuid:41a5887f-8865-4c09-adf7-e362475b143a.

**RDK reference:**

        The code **SHALL** be a valid value for the document type.  
        The codeSystem **SHALL** be the associated OID for “DK IHE classCodes”  
        The displayName **SHALL** be the name for the document type found in the code system “DK IHE classCodes”.  
        
        Example values: 
        $code = “001"
        $displayName = “Klinisk rapport” 
        $codeSystem = ” 1.2.208.184.100.9”  

**XML example:**
        
        <rim:Classification

### creationTime

**General information:**

| Entity        | Optionality | Data type | Source            |
|---|---|---|---|
| DocumentEntry | R           | DTM       | CDA (transformed) |

**Description:**

Represents the time the author created the document.

Please see 2.2.24 serviceStartTime and 2.2.25 serviceStopTime for a thorough understanding of time attributes.

**Coding:**

The format of the creationTime value is data type DTM.

The value is coded as a single value within an ebRIM Slot in the DocumentEntry. The creationTime **SHALL** be precise to the second.

**CDA Reference:**

        $value = ClinicalDocument/effectiveTime/@value  
        
        Note: The CDA data type for time is TS, which includes an offset from UTC. 
        In the XDS metadata the data type for time is DTM, which **SHALL** be given in UTC timezone. 
        This requires that the value for time in the CDA **SHALL** be transformed ($value_DTM) before it is used for the XDS metadata.  
        
        Example: 
        December 25, 2014 21:20:10 UTC 

**XML example:**

        <rim:Slot name="creationTime">  
            <rim:ValueList>

### entryUUID

**General information:**

| Entity         | Optionality | Data type | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| DocumentEntry  | R           | String    | AUT    |

**Description:**

The entryUUID attribute is a globally unique identifier primarily intended for internal document management purposes. In contrast, the uniqueId attribute is used for external references (e.g., links, etc.).

UUIDs **SHALL** be version 4 or 5 and represented in the form XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX, where each X is a character from the set [A-Fa-f0-9].

**Coding:**

The format of the entryUUID value is UUID.

At time of registration, certain Document Sharing transactions **MAY** allow symbolic Ids (anything that does not have the urn:uuid: prefix) to be used. Once submitted and received by a Document Registry or Repository, symbolic Ids will be replaced by UUID values.

The value of the entryUUID is coded in the id XML attribute on the ExtrinsicObject representing the DocumentEntry. In the example below, the entryUUID is urn:uuid:a6e06ca8-0c75-4064-9e5c-88b9045a96f6.

**XML example:**

    <rim:ExtrinsicObject 
        mimeType="text/xml"

### eventCodeList

**General information:**

| Entity        | Optionality | Data type | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| DocumentEntry | R2          | Code      | CDA    |

**Description:**

This list of codes represents the main clinical acts documented for the patient contact.

In health care the clinical process for the treatment of individual patients is based on evidence. The evidence for the individual patient is achieved by performing one or more examinations. The outcome of an examination is clinical “documents”, which for example includes clinical chemistry results, vital signs, images and clinical notes. Based on the outcome of the examinations, the health professionals will be able to point out a diagnosis for the patient’s illness, e.g. diabetes. In many cases the diagnosis is tentative and more examinations are needed to point out the “final” diagnose, which describes the patient’s health problem.

In health care, examinations are procedures, which describe the work to be done, e.g. pulmonary function testing, diabetes annual care review or blood pressure control. For each procedure the related outcome is “pre-defined” and **MAY** include a number of values, which in total will form the result for the examination. In several cases, the individual values cannot be used from an examination without maintaining its overall context.

There is currently no generalized accepted code system chosen for describing procedure code or clinical diagnosis for the main clinical acts of the document.

Special case for home monitoring reporting: Citizens at home are monitoring pulse, oxygen saturation, blood pressure and etc., which are collected and documented. The patient's clinical measured results documented by patient characteristics using NPU code.

**Coding:**

This metadata attribute has a value set *comprised of a sub-set of values defined in a code system*. See this reference for further information see section 1.3.4.1 [DK-IHE_Metadata Value_sets].

The eventCodeList is coded with ebRIM Classification objects. There **MAY** be zero, one, or more ebRIM Classifications containing a code and additional eventCode entries are coded by specifying multiple classification objects. For the eventCodeList metadata attribute, the classificationScheme **SHALL** be urn:uuid:2c6b8cb7-8b2a-4051-b291-b1ae6a575ef4.

**CDA Reference:**

| DocumentEntry | R           | String    | RDK    |

**Description:**

The mimeType element describes the "Internet Media Type" of the document in accordance with the "MIME" (MIME) standard. The standard is described in RFC 2045 to RFC 2049.

**Coding:**

This metadata attribute has a limited allowed value set. See this reference for further information see section 1.3.4.1 [DK-IHE_Metadata Value_sets].

The maximum length is unbounded. **SHALL** have only a single value. Encoded in the ebRS ExtrinsicObject mimeType attribute for the ExtrinsicObject that corresponds to the DocumentEntry.


**RDK reference:**


          In the case of CDA R2 documents, the MimeType according to IHE is always fixed to "text/xml".

**General information:**

| Entity        | Optionality | Data type | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| DocumentEntry | R           | UUID      | RDK    |

**Description:**

The objectType attribute reflects the type of DocumentEntry. There are two DocumentEntry types: Stable Document Entry and On-Demand Document Entry.

A Stable Document Entry contains metadata about an already created document available for retrieval. This document is stable because the contents have been effectively combined in the exact representation that will be returned in a Retrieve Document Set. A Stable DocumentEntry is an DocumentEntry with objectType equal to the UUID for Stable and availabilityStatus = Approved or Deprecated. All metadata fields contain valid values. If the document returned on a retrieve request is CDA, it will have in the ClinicalDocument/id in the HL7 CDA R2 header the same value of the DocumentEntry uniqueId.

An On-Demand DocumentEntry contains metadata, which can be used to create an on-demand document which collects the latest, most recent available information at the time of retrieval. It is designed by setting an objectType equal to the UUID for on-demand. On-Demand Document Entries never reflect actual document content, but rather the potential for a document with the characteristics described in the metadata of the entry. An On-Demand DocumentEntry **MAY** be replaced and deprecated.

**Coding:**

Max length is unbounded. The format of the objectType value is UUID.

The value of the objectType is coded in the objectType XML attribute on the ExtrinsicObject representing the DocumentEntry. In the example below, the objectType is urn:uuid:7edca82f-054d-47f2-a032-9b2a5b5186c1 and reflects a stable DocumentEntry.

**XML example:**

        <rim:ExtrinsicObject mimeType="text/xml"
        id="urn:uuid:a6e06ca8-0c75-4064-9e5c-88b9045a96f6"

### patientId

The patientId attribute **SHALL** be used in this profile (see the specification for the sourcePatientId attribute).

### practiceSettingCode

In Denmark, the practiceSettingCode specifies the clinical specialty described by the value set “DK_IHE_practiceSettingCode”. Currently, all codes of the value set are given by the code system SNOMED CT. See Appendix 1, section 3.10 DK_IHE_practiceSettingCode.

**General information:**

| Entity        | Optionality | Data type | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| DocumentEntry | R           | Code      | RDK    |

**Description:**

The value set for practiceSettingCode represents the type of clinical setting of the clinical encounter during which the documented act occurred. All code values are SNOMED CT identifiers (SCTID). It **SHALL** reflect the specialty of the department which best matches the contents of the document, regardless of the field of study of the author or the creating department.

**Coding:**

This metadata attribute has a limited allowed value set. See this reference for further information see section 1.3.4.1 [DK-IHE_Metadata Value_sets].
